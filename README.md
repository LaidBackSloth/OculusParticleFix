# OculusParticleFix
A Minecraft mod. Available on [Curseforge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/oculus-particle-fix) and [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/oculus-particle-fix).

If you want to get more information on the bug and how my fix works, look at the originalÂ [GitHub issue](https://github.com/Asek3/Oculus/issues/149).

This is how the fix could be implemented in Oculus directly: [gist](https://github.com/Asek3/Oculus/blob/1.18.2-dev/src/main/java/net/coderbot/iris/mixin/fantastic/MixinParticleEngine.java#L73-L89)
